# mELOdy 🎵

**Discover your true music taste through the power of ELO ratings.**

mELOdy connects to your Spotify account and presents you with pairs of songs from your library. Pick the one you like more, and over time, build a personalized ranking of your favorite music.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Spotify** - Log in with your Spotify account
2. **Pick Your Battles** - Choose between two songs from your library
3. **Watch Your Rankings Grow** - Each choice updates the ELO ratings
4. **Discover Your Top Tracks** - See your definitive music rankings

## The ELO System

The same rating system used in chess! When you pick a song:
- The winner gains points
- The loser loses points
- Upsets (picking an underdog) cause bigger swings
- The more you play, the more accurate your rankings become

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Auth**: Spotify OAuth 2.0
- **Database**: SQLite (simple, portable)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
